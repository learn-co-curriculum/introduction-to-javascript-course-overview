## Introduction to Javascript Course Overview

We're glad you're hear learning with us. In this course, we'll take you from the very beginning of your Javascript and programming journey and by the end you'll be able to build this [http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/javascript-rock-dodger/]. Pretty neat, right? 

We'll start with the basics, show you how you can write Javascript right in the browser, and then cover basic data types, variables, and data structures. You'll become comfortable with functions, callbacks, and loops. Then we'll dive into the DOM and jQuery and explore best practices in how Javascript interacts with HTML and CSS in websites. 

Take time reading through the lessons. Some of the labs you encounter will be straightforward while others will be more challenging. Learning to program is hard and we don't dumb it down for you. Sometimes you might find yourself googling for the best way to do something, and we've designed this curriculum so that you do that. Learning how to learn and find answers is a big part of the coding journey. But any time you're stuck, also know that you can use the Ask a Question feature in Learn and we'll be here to help you out!

Happy coding!
